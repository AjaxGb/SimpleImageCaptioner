# Simple Image Captioner

Just a very simple website that allows me to easily add captions to images.

Supports passing values in the query string, for easy automation:

- `caption` - Provides the caption text.
- `img` - Provides the image URL.
- `fontsz` - Provides the font size, in pixels.

All are optional.
